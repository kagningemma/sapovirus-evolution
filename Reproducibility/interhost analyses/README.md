These files were produced during primary and secondary analysis of oubreak samples from miyagi-Japan.
___
**Primary analysis**

A GenBank reference was used for the whole mapping and consensus calling workflow. 
___

**Seconday analysis**

I re-computed the outbreak reference sequence, by merging the near-complete consensus sequences from GI.1 and GI.2 primary analysis into a single file, and I uploaded it to https://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/cons. 
The website calculated the consensus which I checked visually to confirm the result. 
Then, the mapping was done against the outbreak reference sequence to determine divergence between NGS reads and the outbreak consensus sequence.
