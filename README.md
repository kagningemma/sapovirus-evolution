# sapovirus-evolution
Studies of sapovirus intra-genotypic evolution patterns, within and between-host evolution may contribute to a better understanding of worldwide sapovirus epidemiology and evolution. 
I mined whole genbank sapovirus capsid data and uncovered different patterns of evolution between different genotypes. Sapovirus genome was then sequenced using a multiplex amplicon sequencing protocol published by Quick et al, Nat. protocols (https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.066). I compared intrahost and inter-host single nucleotide variations between GI.1 and GI.2 populations using a method evaluated by Grubaugh et al, (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1618-7)
I also compared intrahost genetic diversity of GI.1 and GI.2 populations.
