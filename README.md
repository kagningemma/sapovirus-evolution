# sapovirus-evolution
Studies of sapovirus intra-genotypic evolution patterns, within and between-host evolution may contribute to a better understanding of worldwide sapovirus epidemiology and evolution. Sapovirus genome was sequenced using protocol of Quick et al, Nat. protocols, 2017; and we compared single nucleotide polymorphisms of GI.1 and GI.2 populations within hosts, between-host. I also compared genetic diversity of each viral population.
