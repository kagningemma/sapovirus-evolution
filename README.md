# sapovirus-evolution
Studies of sapovirus intra-genotypic evolution patterns, within and between-host evolution may contribute to a better understanding of worldwide sapovirus epidemiology and evolution. 
I mined whole genbank sapovirus capsid data and uncovered different evolution patterns between. Sapovirus genome was then sequenced using protocol of Quick et al, Nat. protocols, 2017. 
I compared time-wise single nucleotide variations of GI.1 and GI.2 populations within infected hosts.
I also compared intrahost genetic diversity of GI.1 and GI.2 populations. 
I made an attempt to classify sapovirus into larger groups called " immunotypes" and performed additional statistical analyses.
